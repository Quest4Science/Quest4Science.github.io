Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Li Haitian, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). As I embark on my academic journey, I am deeply passionate about the field of computer vision and its potential to transform the world for the better.

My research interests lie in exploring advanced AI methodologies, particularly in 2D and 3D generation, reconstruction, and editing within computer vision. I believe that through rigorous study and innovation, AI can drive positive change across various industries and improve lives globally. This website serves as a platform to share my work, publications, and academic endeavors.

Feel free to explore my research, projects, and thoughts on AI. Let's connect and contribute to the future of artificial intelligence together!
